# B. Usability Requirements
- LAYOUT. The arrangement of text and images on each page should be attractive and well-organized.
    it is :point_right::sunglasses::point_right:
- NAVIGATION. Each page links to each of the others. The navigation must be visible without scrolling and located in the same place on every page. The only exception is the page which serves as a "pop-up".
    5 pages are linked and everything is gooda
- CONSISTENCY. All pages are consistent with the layout: navigation, content, logo, etc. are always in the same place on the page.
    All except index.html should be fine
- TEXT. The text is large enough to read, contrasts strongly with the background color(s), and are pertinent to the site (avoid Lorem Ipsum).
